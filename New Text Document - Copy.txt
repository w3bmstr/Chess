2. Capture template for each feature
When you add an item, use this single line template so everything is comparable.

Feature Title — Category — Priority — V1/V2/Deferred/Excluded — Owner — Notes (1–2 lines)

Example
Puzzles with Hints — Training and Puzzles — High — V2 — Daniel — Needs puzzle DB, hint engine, scoring rules.

Keep a single master file FEATURES.md and append entries with that template.

3. Prioritization matrix you can use instantly
Score each feature on three axes 1–5 and compute a simple priority score.

Impact (user value)

Effort (dev time) — inverse: lower is better

Dependency Risk (how many other systems it touches)

Priority Score = Impact × (6 − Effort) × (6 − DependencyRisk)

Sort descending. This gives you a pragmatic ordering that balances value and feasibility.

4. Decision gates and the nav freeze rule
You already like locking decisions. Use these gates:

Design Freeze — wireframes, nav, and feature matrix approved. No top‑level nav changes without a DCR.

API Freeze — engine public API contract approved. Any API change requires a DCR and migration notes.

Content Freeze — data heavy features (puzzles, opening DB) require a separate content plan and license review.

DCR template minimal fields: Change Summary, Files Affected, UI Impact, Dev Effort, Rollback Plan, Owner.

5. Minimal viable product suggestion from the full list
If you truly want everything eventually, start with a tight MLP that proves the engine and UI:

V1 MLP

Core Engine (movegen, search, eval)

Play View (board, drag/drop, legal highlighting, flip)

Move List (SAN) + PGN/FEN import/export

Move Navigation (start/back/forward/end, undo/redo)

Evaluation Bar + basic engine stats

Autoplay demo mode

Worker integration for nonblocking UI

Everything else becomes V2 or later. This keeps the first release focused and demonstrable.

6. Next practical step for us right now
If you want, paste your current file tree and a handful of features you already care about. I will:

normalize the file tree into a locked proposal,

convert your raw wishlist into FEATURES.md entries using the template,

run the prioritization matrix and return a ranked V1/V2 plan, and

produce the exact DCR template and a sample DCR for “Add Puzzles” so you can see the cost and impact.

You’re doing the right thing by listing everything first. I’ll help you turn that list into a disciplined plan that keeps your nav and scope exactly how you want them.

no open source
Understood — you don’t want this project to be open source. That’s a clear, valid choice. Below is a concise, practical plan that covers legal status, distribution options, protection strategies, and immediate next steps so the repo and product are set up correctly from day one.

Quick summary
Yes: your code is automatically copyrighted the moment you write it.

No open source: choose a proprietary/commercial license or dual‑license model.

Decisions to make now: distribution model (closed repo vs. paid product vs. SaaS), contributor policy, and enforcement approach.

Licensing & legal options (pick one)
1. Fully proprietary (recommended if you want closed source)

Keep repo private.

Add a Proprietary License / EULA file that states usage restrictions, redistribution rules, and commercial terms.

Use a short license header in each source file referencing the EULA.

2. Dual licensing (open + commercial)

Offer a permissive open license for noncommercial use and a paid commercial license for companies.

Requires clear license text and a commercial license agreement.

3. Source-available but restricted

Publish code but with a restrictive license (no commercial use, no forks).

Easier for demos but still risky: “source‑available” is not the same as open source.

4. SaaS-only (no code distribution)

Keep engine code private and expose functionality via a hosted API or web app.

Best for monetization and control; you never ship the core IP.

Practical protections and policies
Copyright

You already own the copyright. Add a copyright header to each file:

© 2026 Daniel. All rights reserved.

License file

Add LICENSE or EULA.txt at repo root with explicit terms (usage, redistribution, liability, jurisdiction).

Contributor policy

If you accept outside contributions later, require a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) or Developer Assignment to ensure you own contributed code.

Access control

Keep the repo private (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket). Use branch protections and PR reviews.

Technical deterrents

Minify/obfuscate distributed builds (client bundles) to make copying harder.

Ship critical logic server‑side (SaaS) where possible.

Enforcement

Monitor for leaks (code search, GitHub search alerts).

Be prepared to send DMCA takedown notices or legal cease‑and‑desist if needed.

Optional IP steps

Consider patents only if you have a novel algorithm or business method worth protecting (expensive and slow).

Trade secret protection: NDAs for contractors, limited access, and internal policies.

Distribution & monetization choices
Closed repo + downloadable paid license — sell compiled bundles or installers.

Closed repo + SaaS — host engine and charge per usage or subscription.

Freemium — limited free demo, paid pro features (book, NNUE, higher hash).

Commercial license + evaluation builds — time‑limited or watermarked builds for evaluation.

Immediate next steps I recommend (practical, do‑this‑now)
Decide distribution model (Closed repo / SaaS / Dual license).

Create LICENSE/EULA.txt with clear terms and copyright notice.

Add file headers to source files referencing the license.

Make repo private and set branch protections.

Draft a short CLA if you might accept contributions later.

Decide what to ship publicly (demo site, minified bundle) and what stays private (core engine).

Add a DECISIONS.md entry: “Project is proprietary; puzzles excluded; DCR required for nav changes” so scope governance is recorded.

I can help with any of these next actions
Draft a proprietary license / EULA tailored to your needs.

Create a copyright header template for all files.

Draft a CLA or contributor policy.

Produce a short distribution plan (SaaS vs. binary vs. demo) with pros/cons.

Tell me which of the immediate steps you want me to draft first and I’ll produce a ready‑to‑paste artifact (license text, header template, or CLA) you can drop into the repo.
